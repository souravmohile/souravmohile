## üî≠ Projects

Here are a few projects that I'm proud of:

- **[House Price Prediction](https://github.com/souravmohile/house-price-prediction)**: This project aims to predict house prices in Mumbai, the city I am from. This is an enhanced project is based on the second chapter "End to end machine learning project" from the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). The original project predicts house prices in california. In this project, we implement some additional ML methods as well as evaluation methods to imrpove the prediction accuracy. 

- **[Fruit Maturity Detector](https://github.com/souravmohile/FruitMaturityDetector)**: In this project, we use a live camera feed to view different types of fruits and then classify them as raw, ripe or overripe and also classify the type of fruit. This project was done as a part of my final year undergraduate degree project. 

- **[British Airways Reviews Analysis and Customer Modelling](https://github.com/souravmohile/BA-ReviewAnalysis)**: In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on BA customer reviews and create visualisations to gain insights on the data. Further, we create a predictive model to understand what influences the customer to book a flight. This project was a job simulation on Forage for British Airways where I was given the data and some instructions about the expectations of the project. The rest has been solely done by me.

- **[Book Reccomendation System](https://github.com/souravmohile/book-reccomendation-system)**: This is a recommendation project built using PyTorch.

Although I would love to share the following projects, I am not permitted to do so since these now belong to Stratiphy, the company I previously worked with.
- <ins>**Financial Statement Analysis**:</ins> This project deals with extracting and analysing data from multiple types of financial documents. The objective of this project was to generate a time series of scores for each company in the following 5 sectors - Risk, Market Conditions, Innovation, Regulatory Compliance and ESG. These scores were later added into a separate pipeline project used for time series prediction of company metrics. Apart from this, the project also provided a feature to summarise documents and chat with the data to gain insights. This was implemented using Retrievel Augmented Generation along with Llama 3.1. 

- <ins>**Chatbot for financial education**:</ins> This chatbot aimed to act as a helping agent for financial education on the app, where users could ask any questions about the company, or about finance in general. It was important to make sure that the chatbot remained unbiased and never provided any sort of financial advice.
